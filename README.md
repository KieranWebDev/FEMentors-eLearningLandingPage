## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile first design

### What I learned

- This was my first time using the picture element as well as srcset. This allowed me to display different images based on the websites screensize. A very useful feature, and one I will be sure to use again!

- I had some trouble getting the main hero image to play nice and position itself correctly. but some googling and stack overflow came to the rescue. I learned about and got some practice with using relative positioning.

- I used the mobile first approach and am starting to feel much more confident building using this approach.

- I tried to use CSS variables as much as possible, but I am not sure if I am using them correctly or at least following best practice. I will read up about it more and ask the community for feedback before beginning the next project.

- I had some trouble with adjusting flexbox settings and began to question everything I know about flexbox, media queries and life before I realized I was missing one curly brace in my css file.

### Continued development

I plan to revisit this challenge and rebuild it with react and tailwind CSS

### Useful resources

- Kevin Powells youtube videos on the picture element and srcsets were very useful for this challenge.
- [The HTML picture element explained [ Images on the web part 3 ]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rik3gHT24AM&t=801s) - This helped me with the CSS on the main image.

- [srcset and sizes attributes - [ images on the web | part one ]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QYpkrX2N48&t=7s) - This helped me with the CSS on the main image.
